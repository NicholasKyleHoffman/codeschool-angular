==================

Code for the Google-sponsored Codeschool AngularJS tutorial you can find here: [http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro).

The repo contains the final code at the end of the course, but you can use `git checkout` to jump through the various commit logs.
