==================

Code for the Google-sponsored Codeschool AngularJS tutorial you can find here: [http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro).


The repo contains the final code at the end of the course, but you can use `git checkout` to jump through the various commit logs.

## Starting the local dev server

If you don't have already some webserver running to load up the application, I've included a corresponding grunt task. Simply execute

```
$ npm install
```

to fetch all dependencies followed by 

```
$ grunt serve
```

..to fire up a webserver at port `8000`.

**Prerequisites:** nodejs + npm.
